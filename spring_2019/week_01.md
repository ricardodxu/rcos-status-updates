## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Communicated with old members of the project and got more familiar with the project. Also I started reading current code and tried to understand them better.

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue reading the part of code related to database and hopefully I can understand this part as well.

## Anything Blocking?

> The problem of split the hand-writing word by characters is very hard. It might cost long time to solve.
